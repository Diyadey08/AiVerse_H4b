## 🤖 What is AI-Verse?

*AI-Verse* is an *extensible AI agent framework* crafted to fuse *LLM reasoning* with *real-world actions – all within your browser*. Developed using ⚡ Next.js and powered by the **Vercel AI SDK**, it empowers you to build, test, and launch intelligent agents with modular prompts and pluggable tools.

Whether you're prototyping a smart assistant, creating autonomous bots, or building prompt-based workflows — *AI-Verse* gives you the platform to explore the multiverse of AI.

## 🚀 Features at a Glance

- ⚙️ **Dynamic Tool Execution** – Agents can run real-time tasks like web searches, shell commands, sending emails, and more.
- 🧠 **Prompt Playground** – Experiment and iterate with AI prompts in real time.
- 🧩 **Selective Tool Use** – Enable only the tools your agent needs.
- 📦 **Fully Modular** – Plug in new tools with simple APIs.
- 🎨 **Modern UI** – Built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide for a beautiful, dev-first experience.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nabhocharger69/Phoenix_Builders.git
cd Phoenix_Builders
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file and add the following:

```env
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your-google-generative-ai-api-key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-api-key
SERP_API_KEY=your-serp-api-key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-oauth-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-oauth-client-secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
CORSEL_API_KEY=your-corsel-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY=your-pinata-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=your-pinata-api-secret
```

### 4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit [https://ai-verse-h4b.vercel.app/](https://ai-verse-h4b.vercel.app/) to explore **AI-Verse**.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Define an agent’s prompt and message flow.
2. Select the required tools via the UI.
3. Backend filters and provides tool access to the AI.
4. The AI calls tools autonomously based on user inputs.
